# MBH_CatalystDiscovery

This repository includes code for the workflow and data analysis described in 

* Maria H. Rasmussen, Julius Seumer, and Jan H. Jensen. "De Novo Catalyst Discovery: Fast Identification of New Catalyst
Candidates", _ChemRxiv_ (June 2023)

## Data availability

Data generated as part of the work described in the above paper is available [here](https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/C4RVLJdhC5)

The data repository includes

* .csv files containing the mapped reaction SMILES and count for the three meta-MD iterations (metaMD_reactions)
* .xyz files for fragments optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/SMD(methanol) level of theory (fragment_energies_dft)
* .xyz file for the transition state structures found (TS_structures) at the same level of theory
* output files for the five genetic algorithm runs (GA_output)
